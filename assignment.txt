Create your own layout using the more advanced method of creating separate columns for the content (left and right). Make sure to have a header, area for a menu and a footer, in addition to the content area. Size can be your choice although it is a good idea to go for something greater than or equal to 700 pixels. 

Do not put borders around the content areas (left and right) but make sure there is padding for the content to breathe. Put a header with 3 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text and at least 1 image in the content area. 

Color the smaller widget area" sidebar another color or put your choice of content (widgets, pictures, other text, etc) in to take up space. include any plans or sketches.
