create a table with the class name "statstable".
create an alternate style table with at least 5 columns and at least 6 rows.
These columns can use fake data, but make sure the data is real not garbage.
ie - use numbers and names but not "jfeiojfwejfwel" text.

Place the table in a container div. The container div class name is "main". It will be centered. Make it 700 pixels wide and a minimum of 400 pixels tall, with a 20 pixel padding and 1 pixel black border. Add 30 pixels to the top margin. display the table in the main content area with the heading "First Quarter Results". Add a paragraph of lorem ipsum text before and after the table. Stylize the table header to be different than the rows and use alternate style settings for the alternate rows.
