Create an HTML registration form with the following controls:

Name - textbox
Username - textbox
Password - password textbox
confirm password - password textbox
Address 1 - textbox
Address 2 - textbox
Email Address - textbox
Province - select (drop down with provinces)
I agree to the Terms and Conditions - checkbox
Submit button
Reset Button

Do not worry about functionality at this point we will come back to HTML forms later and use them in PHP and javascript.
